unboundid-ldapsdk-2.3.3-nonsealed.jar is the exact copy of unboundid-ldapsdk-2.3.3.jar available in the maven central
repository with one single difference: it's not sealed (META-INF/MANIFEST.MF doesn't contain "Sealed: true").
This really nasty workaround was necessary, because some of the classes in this jar had to be extended in order to mock the
behavior of an Active Directory server, however these classes are final. In order to be able to replace the original classes
with patched (non-final) versions in another deployment unit, it became necessary to un-seal the jar...
